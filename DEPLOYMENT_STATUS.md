# 🎉 DEPLOYMENT STATUS - ALL ISSUES FIXED!

## ✅ Current Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

All issues have been identified and resolved. The system is now fully functional.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Frontend ABI Sync Issue → ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Frontend ABIs were outdated and didn't match deployed contracts
- **Solution**: Re-copied ABIs using `node scripts/copy-abis.js` after fresh deployment
- **Status**: ✅ ABIs now synced with latest contract build

### 2. ❌ Ethereum Node Connectivity → ✅ FIXED  
- **Problem**: Local Hardhat node was stopped/restarted causing RPC failures
- **Solution**: Restarted Hardhat node and verified it's running on localhost:8545
- **Status**: ✅ Node running with 20 test accounts (10,000 ETH each)

### 3. ❌ Contract Address Mismatch → ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Frontend using old contract addresses that didn't exist
- **Solution**: Fresh deployment with new addresses properly saved to frontend
- **Status**: ✅ All addresses synced and verified working

### 4. ❌ Incomplete Deployment → ✅ FIXED
- **Problem**: Some contracts were missing or partially deployed
- **Solution**: Complete deployment with verification and test data setup
- **Status**: ✅ All contracts deployed, tested, and functional
