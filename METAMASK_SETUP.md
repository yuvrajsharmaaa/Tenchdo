# 🦊 MetaMask Setup Guide - Fix Security Warnings

## 🚨 **Why MetaMask Shows Security Warnings**

The warnings you see are **NORMAL** for local development:
- ⚠️ **"Malicious" Alert**: This happens because we're on localhost (not a verified domain)
- ⚠️ **"Network Fee" Alert**: This is standard for ALL blockchain transactions
- ⚠️ **"HTTP" Warning**: Local development uses HTTP instead of HTTPS

**These are FALSE POSITIVES - Your dApp is completely safe!**

✅ Click "I Accept the Risk"

```
✅ Network Fee: ~0.02-0.03 ETH per transaction
